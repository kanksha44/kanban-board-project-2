# Kanban Board

A Kanban board is a project management tool that visualizes tasks and their progress in an intuitive and organized manner. This project aims to develop a **Kanban board using React**, providing users with a seamless task management experience.

## Features

1. **React Development Environment Setup**: The project utilizes the `create-react-app` command or the `vite` tool to set up the React development environment.

2. **Kanban Board Layout**: The Kanban board layout consists of a top navigation bar, an "Add Another List" component, a list component, a card component, and a button to change the background image.

3. **Drag and Drop Functionality**: The application implements drag and drop functionality to enable users to move tasks between columns. This functionality is achieved by leveraging popular libraries such as React DnD or react-beautiful-dnd.

4. **State Management**: The application manages its state using the `useState` hook and explores the use of `useReducer` for more complex state management scenarios.

5. **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks to the board and edit existing tasks. This functionality enhances task management capabilities and allows for efficient collaboration.

6. **Customizations**: Users have the ability to customize the Kanban board by editing tag names and changing the background image. This feature enhances the visual appeal and personalization of the board.
